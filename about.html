          <div class="homeDesc" data-aos="fade-up">
            My interest lies in the creation of graphic visuals, aesthetic based interactions, and their roles within physical environments. While my design skills are focused on branding, layout design, and 2D motion graphics, I also have experience in art direction, exhibition design, curation, and web design. My personal hobbies include film photography, illustration, and sewing.
            <br><br>
            I graduated from Dawson College with a DEC in Graphic Design in 2016. I’m currently an undergraduate student in the Design and Computation Arts program at Concordia University.
            I'm also currently employed at Sid Lee Montreal as a motion designer.
